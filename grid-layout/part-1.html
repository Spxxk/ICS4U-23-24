Grid Lines and Grid Cells:

Explain what grid lines are and how they function in Grid Layout:
Grid lines are the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid layout. 
They define the start and end of grid tracks, which are the row or column spaces between two adjacent grid lines.

Grid lines help in positioning grid items within the grid container. 
They can be referenced by their numerical index or by a name (if specified). 
These references are used to place items or determine their span within the grid layout.



Describe what a grid cell is and how it relates to grid lines:
A grid cell is the individual space or "box" bounded by adjacent vertical and horizontal grid lines.

Grid cells are formed by the intersection of vertical (column) and horizontal (row) grid lines. 
Each grid cell represents the smallest unit of the grid and can house one or more grid items.



Draw a simple diagram to illustrate a grid container with grid lines and cells.
