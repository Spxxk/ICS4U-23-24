The grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties serve as foundational pillars for setting up a grid layout. 
They allow developers to define the structure of grids in terms of the number of columns and rows and their respective sizes. 
With these properties, developers can create intricate and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and content 
requirements. By offering a precise method to control layout dimensions and positioning, 
these properties eliminate many of the complications and hacks traditionally associated with CSS layouts.
